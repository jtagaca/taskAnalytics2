## About

Task Analytics is a Java application that allows you to perform data analysis on the time spent on a specific task.

## Context

This full-stack project consists of both a PHP backend and a Java front end. MySQL is hosted on a database server on a CSUB server and is used for data persistence. This is the final project for a class; it was produced by only me as a developer in only two weeks; thus, the user interface is not very professional. However, this project was intended to aid the client in determining which tasks they spend the most time on and how long they spend on each task.

## Challenges

The fact that I had minimal experience with Java and PHP made this project difficult. However, as you can see, it still works despite my lack of experience. This is due to my research and study of Java and PHP, which I accomplished by watching tutorials and reading documentation on how to implement specific features.
