## About
Task Analytics is a Java application that allows you to perform data analysis on the time spent on a specific task.

## Context
This full-stack project consists of both a PHP backend and a Java front end. MySQL is hosted on a database server on a CSUB server and is used for data persistence. This is the final project for a class; it was produced by only me as a developer in only two weeks; thus, the user interface is not very professional. However, this project was intended to aid the client in determining which tasks they spend the most time on and how long they spend on each task.
## Challenges

The challenges for this project were that I had only three months of experience with Java and PHP. Therefore I was not proficient in their use. However, as you can see, even though this is my first app, it still provides functionality. Moreover, it solves problems for time management when  consumers use it.
